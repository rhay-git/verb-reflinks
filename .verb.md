**Why should I use use?**

`verb-reflinks` makes it easy to write documentation that references other libraries, by simply adding the name, like `[foo][]`, without having to remember or write the entire URL to the GitHub repository.

## Usage

Use as a `.postRender` or `.preWrite` middleware.

```js
var reflinks = require('{%= name %}');
var verb = require('verb');
var app = verb();

app.postRender(/\.md$/, reflinks());
```

**What does this do?**

* Finds reflinks like `[gulp][]` or `[gulp]`
* Resolves the `homepage` or `repository.url` from the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) package name
* Appends the resolve reflink, `[gulp]: http://gulpjs.com`, to the markdown string if it doesn't already exist

**Must be a valid npm name**

For reflinks to be fixed, the reflink text must match the name of a valid npm package. For example `[Foo Bar][]` won't be resolved, but `[gulp][]` would.
